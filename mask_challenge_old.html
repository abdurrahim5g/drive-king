						<p>Masks (also referred to as “barrier face coverings”) are products worn on the face that
							provide varying degrees of protection to the wearer and have the potential to filter
							respiratory secretions from the wearer to help prevent disease transmission to others (i.e.,
							they may provide source control). Many public health agencies worldwide are encouraging
							their citizens to wear masks when in public spaces in order to reduce the spread of
							infectious respiratory diseases. However, there remain notable barriers that reduce overall
							mask usage. These barriers include issues such as contact dermatitis with prolonged wear,
							physical discomfort, fogging of eyeglasses, and difficulty communicating. In addition, many
							masks that are currently available tout unconfirmed protective capabilities that lack
							scientific evidence to support such claims. Overall, there is a need to develop better
							designs, materials, and technologies that are more acceptable to wearers and that ensure
							quantified measures of performance.
						<p>To address these issues and accelerate the development of the next generation of masks, BARDA
							and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) have partnered to
							launch the Mask Innovation Challenge: Building Tomorrow’s Mask. NIOSH is part of the US
							Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. NIOSH is responsible for conducting research and
							making recommendations for the prevention of work-related injury and illness. The Mask
							Innovation Challenge aims to improve the comfort, utility, and protective capabilities of
							products that are worn during day-to-day activities by the general public when physical
							distancing is not possible. This competition is designed to support the development of mask
							designs that meet defined performance standards while also overcoming barriers to use. </p>
						<p>The Mask Innovation Challenge seeks to develop innovative and effective designs for
							mass-producible, low-cost-per-use devices to be worn by the general public in order to
							provide protection from respiratory disease pathogens. Furthermore, users of these devices
							should be able to put them on and wear them without extensive fitting procedures or
							complicated user instructions. Barriers that reduce compliance with mask usage include, but
							are not limited to:</p>
						</p>
						<ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
							<li>Currently available retail devices are often untested, with unknown protective
								capability</li>
							<li>Physical discomfort with prolonged use, particularly in hot and humid environments</li>
							<li>Contact dermatitis with extended wear</li>
							<li>Inability to effectively communicate with others using facial expressions</li>
							<li>Speech intelligibility</li>
							<li>Lack of understanding of the device’s features</li>
							<li>Fogging of eyeglasses during use</li>
							<li>Difficulty finding a device that is the proper size</li>
						</ul>

										<p>The challenge will run for a minimum of 6 months and will be divided into two
											phases, followed by a possible third phase. All respondents are eligible for
											Phase 1. Participation in Phase 2 is not dependent upon participation in
											Phase 1; however, winners from Phase 1 will be eligible to receive
											additional points for consideration in the final judging process for Phase
											2.</p>

										<p><strong>(1) Phase 1: Design</strong> – Respondents will be asked to submit
											their concepts for a redesigned mask according to the stipulations in this
											announcement. Up to 40 regional winners (within up to 4 regions) will be
											selected to move on to the DRIVe Accelerator Network Product Pitch
											Competition, where they will present their design to a panel of federal and
											non-federal experts. Of those finalists, up to 10 will be selected to
											receive the final prize of up to $10,000 each to create a prototype of their
											concept. Prototypes and physical products will not be tested in Phase 1, but
											may be eligible for consideration in future phases.</p>
										<strong>a. Innovation Tracks:</strong>
										<p> i. Mask: Designs in this track focus on improving upon already existing
											designs for masks.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>1. Masks that are selected for testing in future phases may be evaluated
												against the following criteria in future phases:</li>
											<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
												<li>Achieve filtration efficiency ≥20% against a sodium chloride (NaCl)
													aerosol challenge with a count median diameter of 75 ± 20 nm and a
													geometric standard deviation of 1.86 at a flowrate of 85 ± 4 Lpm. If
													the specimen lays flat in the filter holder, the flowrate will be
													adjusted to achieve a face velocity of 10 cm/sec.</li>
												<li>Achieve inhalation airflow resistance of ≤15 mm H2O at a flowrate of
													85 ± 4 Lpm. If the specimen lies flat in the filter holder, the
													flowrate will be adjusted to achieve a face velocity of 10 cm/sec
												</li>
												<li>Ability to reduce inward leakage of particles into the breathing
													zone across the interface of the device and the face. The testing
													may be performed using people or a manikin headform.</li>
												<li>Other criteria as deemed necessary in later phases</li>
											</ol>

										</ol>

										<p><strong>ii. Other Designs/Technologies:</strong> Designs in this track
											incorporate new technologies and materials that have not yet been included
											in current mask designs</p>
										<ol>
											<li>1. Designs may be judged on an individual basis in future phases by
												performance testing of prototypes. Because designs may be innovative,
												new test methods and criteria may need to be developed to evaluate:</li>
											<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
												<li>Filtration efficiency </li>
												<li>Inhalation airflow resistance </li>
												<li>Ability to reduce inward leakage of particles into the breathing
													zone across the interface of the device and the face. The testing
													may be performed using people or a manikin headform. </li>
												<li>Other test methods as deemed necessary depending on the design </li>
											</ol>

										</ol>
										<p> <strong>Prize Purse:</strong> Up to 10 Phase 1 winners will receive up to
											$10,000 each </p>



										<p><strong>(2) Phase 2: Proof of Concept</strong> – Challenge participants will
											be asked to submit their solutions in response to a scenario. Finalists will
											be invited to submit a lot of prototypes for proof-of-concept testing by
											NIOSH laboratories and other partner laboratories. More details on Phase 2
											will be provided by an update to this announcement in the future.</p>
										<p><strong>Prize Purse:</strong> Total prize purse of $400,000, divided among 5
											winners, to be determined later. </p>

								illnesses and injuries caused by individual threat agents. In
								doing so, BARDA has found that systemic problems across most of
								the illnesses and injuries must also be resolved to save lives.
								DRIVe will solve problems that many health security threats have
								in common, systemic challenges, leveraging the flexibility
								provided to BARDA under the 21st Century Cures Act.</p>
							<p>To infuse a new entrepreneurial spirit into biodefense,
								DRIVe draws the best in the field and the best in the business
								together to define the challenges. DRIVe accelerators across the
								country work like prospectors, identifying innovative potential
								solutions. We recognize that innovation can come from anyone
								anywhere in the U.S., or around the world, not just from Silicon
								Valley. DRIVe's nonprofit venture capital innovation partner
								will join other venture capitalists in funding development of
								the solution. Advanced development and manufacturing could be
								completed with support from BARDA through its portfolio
								partnerships, traditional contracts, or other transaction
								authority, through the innovation partner, or by private
								industry. Since many of the challenges DRIVe must solve for
								health security are also common problems in health care and
								biotechnology (examples: sepsis, detecting illness immediately),
								private investment is likely to further drive those solutions to
								the commercial market.</p>

								up to 10 Challenge winners for Phase 1, as well as any honorable mentions, subject to

							<strong>Judging Criteria</strong>
							<p>Proposals will be graded on the following metrics, in no particular order of importance,
								by a panel of federal judges, which may also include initial rounds of review by a panel
								of subject matter experts:</p>

							<ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
								<li>Technological Feasibility – Submission demonstrates a reasonable rationale for the
									design of the mask, proposes an intuitive design that can be used without fitting or
									prior training, and contains components that are easily accessible for production.
								</li>
								<li>Innovation – Submission advances the state of the art in filtration efficacy,
									comfort, and utility of masks used by the general public. Additional considerations
									include the scientific evidence and rationale behind the proposed filtration or
									particle reduction/removal mechanism, clear demonstration of comfort, and the
									ability to tailor the fit of the mask to different face shapes (i.e., women,
									children, those with facial hair or glasses, etc.) </li>
								<li>Barriers – Submission addresses barriers and limitations of currently available
									masks; proposed innovations are based on scientific and technical merit. </li>
								<li>Overall – Submission is realistic, well-rounded, and presents a compelling solution
									that should be considered further.
